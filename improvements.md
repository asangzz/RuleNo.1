# Project Improvements & Updates

## [Initial Setup] - 2024-05-22
- **Tech Stack Migration**: Migrated from Flutter to Next.js (TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, App Router).
- **Project Scaffolding**: Initialized Next.js project with a minimalist dark theme.
- **UI/UX Foundation**:
    - Integrated 'Inter' font.
    - Configured global styles for a minimalist dark mode aesthetic (matching LifeGrid).
    - Implemented `MainLayout` and `Navigation` components.
- **Firebase Integration**: Set up Firebase SDK for client-side Auth and Firestore.

## [Core Features Implementation] - 2024-05-23
- **Rule No. 1 Logic**: Implemented core Phil Town investment formulas (Sticker Price, MOS Price, Payback Time) in `src/lib/rule-one.ts`.
- **Watchlist Page**: Created a functional watchlist with Firestore integration, allowing users to track stocks and see real-time MOS status.
- **Enhanced Dashboard**: Updated the main dashboard with summary statistics, a 52-week market consistency heatmap, and activity feed, matching the LifeGrid design language.
- **AI Business Analysis**: Integrated Gemini 1.5 Pro via Server Actions to provide deep-dives into "Wonderful Business" criteria (Meaning, Moat, Management).
- **Utility Improvements**: Added `cn` utility for Tailwind class merging and initialized `firebase-admin` for future server-side logic.

- **Payback Time Calculator**:
    - Enhanced `calculatePaybackTime` logic in `src/lib/rule-one.ts` to support yearly breakdowns and a 20-year limit.
    - Created a dedicated "Payback Time" tool page with interactive inputs and data visualization of accumulated earnings.
    - Updated global navigation for easy access.

## [Authentication & Multi-Tenancy] - 2024-05-24
- **Firebase Auth Integration**: Implemented full authentication flow using Firebase Auth.
- **Auth Context**: Created a React Context (`AuthContext`) to manage user state globally.
- **Protected Routes**: Implemented `ProtectedRoute` component to handle redirection and secure access to the dashboard, watchlist, analysis, and payback-time tools.
- **Login & Sign Up Pages**: Developed minimalist, dark-themed authentication pages matching the LifeGrid aesthetic.
- **User-Specific Data**: Migrated Firestore queries to use user-specific collections (`users/{userId}/watchlist`), ensuring data privacy and multi-tenancy.
- **Navigation Updates**: Added conditional navigation links and sign-out functionality.

## [Stock Data Integration] - 2024-05-25
- **Real-time Stock Price Integration**: Integrated `yahoo-finance2` to fetch live stock data (price, EPS, company name).
- **Stock Service**: Created `src/lib/stock-service.ts` as a reusable utility for stock data fetching.
- **Automated Watchlist Entry**: Added a "Fetch" feature in the Watchlist page to automatically populate stock details by ticker, reducing manual data entry.
- **Server Actions**: Implemented `fetchStockInfo` server action to handle backend stock data requests.

## [Advanced Analytics & Personalization] - 2024-05-26
- **Historical Growth Analysis**: Enhanced `src/lib/stock-service.ts` to fetch 10 years of EPS, Revenue, and Equity data.
- **Growth Visualization**: Created a `GrowthGrid` component to visualize financial trends with color-coded growth/decline indicators, matching the LifeGrid aesthetic.
- **Improved Watchlist Automation**: `fetchStockInfo` now calculates a robust `historicalHighPE` by averaging historical annual high PEs, reducing manual estimation.
- **Payback Time Enhancements**: Added a "Fetch" feature and "Save to Watchlist" functionality directly from the Payback Time calculator.
- **User Settings**: Implemented a settings page for preferred currency and target Margin of Safety (MOS) percentage, stored in Firestore.
- **Code Quality**: Fixed various TypeScript and linting issues to ensure a clean, type-safe codebase.

### Next Steps:
- Implement automated growth rate estimation from historical data.
- Add more "Moat" indicators (e.g., ROIC tracking).
- Enhance the AI analysis with the newly available historical growth data.
