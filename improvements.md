## [Core Features Implementation] - 2024-05-23
- **Rule No. 1 Logic**: Implemented core Phil Town investment formulas (Sticker Price, MOS Price, Payback Time) in `src/lib/rule-one.ts`.
- **Watchlist Page**: Created a functional watchlist with Firestore integration, allowing users to track stocks and see real-time MOS status.
- **Enhanced Dashboard**: Updated the main dashboard with summary statistics, a 52-week market consistency heatmap, and activity feed, matching the LifeGrid design language.
- **AI Business Analysis**: Integrated Gemini 1.5 Pro via Server Actions to provide deep-dives into "Wonderful Business" criteria (Meaning, Moat, Management).
- **Utility Improvements**: Added `cn` utility for Tailwind class merging and initialized `firebase-admin` for future server-side logic.

- **Payback Time Calculator**:
    - Enhanced `calculatePaybackTime` logic in `src/lib/rule-one.ts` to support yearly breakdowns and a 20-year limit.
    - Created a dedicated "Payback Time" tool page with interactive inputs and data visualization of accumulated earnings.
    - Updated global navigation for easy access.

## [Authentication & Multi-Tenancy] - 2024-05-24

- **Login & Sign Up Pages**: Developed minimalist, dark-themed authentication pages matching the LifeGrid aesthetic.
- **User-Specific Data**: Migrated Firestore queries to use user-specific collections (`users/{userId}/watchlist`), ensuring data privacy and multi-tenancy.
- **Navigation Updates**: Added conditional navigation links and sign-out functionality.

## [Stock Data Integration] - 2024-05-25
- **Real-time Stock Price Integration**: Integrated `yahoo-finance2` to fetch live stock data (price, EPS, company name).

- **Automated Watchlist Entry**: Added a "Fetch" feature in the Watchlist page to automatically populate stock details by ticker, reducing manual data entry.
- **Server Actions**: Implemented `fetchStockInfo` server action to handle backend stock data requests.

### Next Steps:
- Implement data visualization for historical EPS and PE growth.
- Add "Save to Watchlist" functionality directly from the Payback Time calculator.
- Implement user profile settings (e.g., preferred currency, target MOS percentage).
